Description

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&emsp;  Probabilistic Graphical Models for Computer Vision  introduces probabilistic graphical 
models (PGMs) for computer vision problems and teaches how to develop the PGM model from
training data. This book discusses PGMs and their significance in the context of solving
computer vision problems, giving the basic concepts, definitions and properties. It also
provides a comprehensive introduction to well-established theories for different types of 
PGMs, including both directed and undirected PGMs, such as Bayesian Networks, Markov 
Networks and their variants.
